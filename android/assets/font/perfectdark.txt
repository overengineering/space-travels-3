Perfect Dark  Created by Brian Kent

Thanks for Downloading Perfect Dark.


  This Font is based on the Logo from the game Perfect Dark.

  This Font uses Character Extenders [ !@#$%^ ] to give some of the
characters in the Font a longer TOP (when you have the letters A, a, D
and/or d in your text). For example, if you type out Perfect Dark",
type it out like this, Perfect D@a%rk" to give the a and r in Dark
extenders.  Each Extender is a different size:

! =x1 length
@ =x2 length
# =x3 length
$ =x4 length
% =x5 length
^ =x6 length

  The following characters do not use extenders: CcGgjOoQqSsXx0589"',.


  The whole Font is made with Capital letters but some of the
Characters have more than 1 letter Character.  They are:
Ee [the e has a slightly higher middle prong like in the PD LOGO]
Ff [the f has a slightly higher lower prong like in the PD LOGO]
Gg
Hh
Ii
Jj
Nn
Oo [you can also use 0 and ) for the O's or 0's]
Ss [you can also use 5 for an S and vice versa]
Uu
Vv
Xx


  A few last things.  This Font uses A LOT of Kerning to make the
Characters fit correctly so make sure what ever program you're using
have Character Kerning ON (sometimes if you're using a text editor
like Microsoft Word, you usualy have turn the Kerning ON).  Finally,
to make the Font look more like the Games Logo (slanted), use Italic
on the Font.
